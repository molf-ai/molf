# Worker Overview

A worker is a headless process that connects to the Molf server, registers its available tools and skills, and executes tool calls dispatched by the server. Each worker operates within a specific working directory, and all file operations are scoped to that directory.

Workers connect **to** the server and wait for instructions — they never communicate directly with clients.

**Responsibilities:**

- Execute tool calls (shell commands, file I/O, search) on behalf of the LLM
- Load and report skills from the working directory
- Handle file uploads from clients
- Reconnect automatically after disconnections

## Running a Worker

```bash
bun run dev:worker -- --name my-worker --token <server-token>
```

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Short | Description | Default | Env Var |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `--name` | `-n` | Worker name (required) | — | — |
| `--workdir` | `-w` | Working directory | Current directory | — |
| `--server-url` | `-s` | WebSocket server URL | `ws://127.0.0.1:7600` | `MOLF_SERVER_URL` |
| `--token` | `-t` | Auth token (required) | — | `MOLF_TOKEN` |

**Example** — point a worker at a specific project:

```bash
bun run dev:worker -- \
  --name my-project \
  --workdir ~/projects/my-app \
  --token abc123
```

## Worker Identity

Each worker has a persistent UUID stored at `{workdir}/.molf/worker.json`:

```json
{ "workerId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" }
```

- Created automatically on first run.
- Reused on subsequent runs from the same working directory.
- Sessions are bound to a worker by its UUID. Because the ID persists, sessions remain bound after a worker restart or reconnection — no manual re-linking required.

## Connection & Reconnection

Workers connect to the server over WebSocket. The connection URL includes the auth token, worker ID, and worker name as query parameters:

```
ws://{host}:{port}?token={token}&clientId={workerId}&name={workerName}
```

On connect, the worker registers itself with `worker.register`, reporting its tools, skills, and metadata (working directory path, AGENTS.md content). It then subscribes to `worker.onToolCall` and `worker.onUpload` to receive dispatched work.

### Connection States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `disconnected` | Not connected to the server |
| `connecting` | Initial connection attempt in progress |
| `registered` | Connected and registered with the server |
| `reconnecting` | Connection lost, attempting to reconnect |

### Automatic Reconnection

If the connection drops, the worker reconnects automatically with exponential backoff:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Initial delay | 1 second |
| Maximum delay | 30 seconds |
| Multiplier | 2x |
| Jitter | ±25% |

Tool result delivery retries up to **3 times** with a 1-second base delay if the initial submission fails.

## Workdir Layout

```
<workdir>/
├── AGENTS.md                     # Always-loaded instructions (see Skills)
├── skills/
│   ├── deploy/
│   │   └── SKILL.md              # On-demand skill (see Skills)
│   └── review/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── .molf/
    ├── worker.json               # { "workerId": "<uuid>" }
    └── uploads/                  # Files uploaded by clients
        └── <uuid>-<filename>
```

- **AGENTS.md** — Project-level instructions injected into every system prompt. See [Skills](/worker/skills).
- **skills/** — On-demand skill definitions loaded lazily by the LLM. See [Skills](/worker/skills).
- **.molf/worker.json** — Persistent worker identity.
- **.molf/uploads/** — Uploaded files, saved as `{uuid}-{sanitized_filename}` with path traversal protection.

## Path Resolution

All built-in tools resolve relative paths against the worker's working directory. Some tools also default their path argument to the workdir when it's omitted:

| Tool | Path Argument | Defaults to Workdir |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| `shell_exec` | `cwd` | Yes |
| `read_file` | `path` | No |
| `write_file` | `path` | No |
| `edit_file` | `path` | No |
| `glob` | `path` | Yes |
| `grep` | `path` | Yes |

This resolution is handled transparently by the tool executor — the LLM can use relative paths like `src/main.ts` and they resolve correctly.
